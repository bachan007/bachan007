## 🧠 About Me

I specialize in building intelligent systems that combine **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multi-Agent Architectures**, and **cloud-native data pipelines** to drive automation, insight, and scale for enterprises.

Currently working at the intersection of:
- **Generative AI**: RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, LangChain agents
- **AI/ML**: NLP, active learning loops, unsupervised clustering
- **Data Engineering**: Scalable ETL on Azure (Databricks, Synapse, ADF)
